A Dart client API to [DuckDb](https://duckdb.org) 

## Features
Sending and executing statements works.  Fetching the data back works for several data types.  
One major exception is `enums` (I haven't figured out how to do it.) 

Everything is sync ðŸ˜ƒ.  

## Getting started
Install the package

## Usage


```dart
final con = Connection.inMemory();
con.execute('');
var result = con.fetch('SELECT * FROM tbl;');

con.close();
```
